# Team 8 - CSE 110
## Original Project by Team Byte (Group 8 - CSE 110 Fall 22')

Check out our [Team Page](admin/team.md)!

This project is a Expense Tracker to help others manage their expenses and
stay financially responsible. Unlike many other expense trackers, our expense tracker provides features like:
- Login security preventing unauthorized access to local accounts
- Categorized Expenses for organized displays
- Expense Breakdowns categorizing the expense from needs, wants, and savings
