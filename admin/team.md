# Team 8: The Byte

Eight bits in a byte - the fundamental building block of every software program in existence. At the Byte, each bit in out team plays a pivotal role in working together towards the common goal of developing a CRUD app that incorporates local-first ideologies. Although we may come from different technical backgrounds, the sum of our own individual experiences culminates into something far greater than any single person could bring. The summation of our front-end, back-end, organizational, and development pattern knowledge immediately sets us up for success in our imminent software endeavor. 

## Our Values 
Our goal is to promote a fostering and encouraging atmosphere in our team in an attempt to build psychological safety within our group. We expect to do this by: 

- 00000001 - Focus
  - Everyone is engaged and focused on their issue at hand. Each person understands the importance of their work in the larger context of the overall project. 

- 00000010 - Commitment
  - Everyone is committed to delivering their work in a timely and efficient manner. Effort is never below a hundred percent. 

- 00000011 - Respect
  - Each team member respects their co-workers to be independent and capable individuals. They take advantage of everyone's unique technical background and experiences.    

- 00000100 - Openness
  - Failures aren't hidden and roadblocks are actively shared to leverage knowledge from the rest of the team members.
