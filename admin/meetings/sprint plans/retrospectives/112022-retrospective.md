### Discussion
- Things that worked
  - Doing more pair programming (in person work)
  - Transitioning from Electron JS to traditional Javascript
- Things that didn't work
  - Disconnect between each teams
    - Solution: invite everyone to all team slack channels
  - Scope of the project is limited - Local first (needs Localstorage)
  - Didn't quite completely finish the Login page as planned
