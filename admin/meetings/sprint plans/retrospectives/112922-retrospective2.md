### Discussion
- Things that worked
  - Engagement/Mastery
    - People were more engaged and were more certain on what to do
  - Meeting in-person/work-sessions
- Things that didn't work
  - We heavily focused on implementing the software, but fell behind with documentation. 
  - Focus on individual team work - slightly inefficient
