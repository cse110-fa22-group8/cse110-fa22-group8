# Team 8 Contract Agreement

## *What Is Expected On The Team*
Throughout this quarter, team 8 will develop a CRUD app with the necessary requirements as stated in the rubric. Our success will depend on the participation, cooperation, and accountability of its team members. Each member is expected to meet deadlines or notify a day in advance if the task can not be completed to minimize the risk of other members getting held back. 

## *How We Will Resolve Conflicts*
Conflicts regarding project decisions will be resolved during the team meetings. We will collectively establish pros and cons to comprise a solution that best captures an agreement between the members. Decisions will be made in a democratic fashion and conducted during meetings. In the event of a group member **violating** the rules the team leads and TA will follow up with a briefing regarding their actions. 

## *Our Commitment To Each Other*
- Participation in meeting whether it is critiques, improvements, and/or ideas. 
- Sticking to responsibilities and maintaining communication between group members if and when set-backs arise. 
  - Communicate difficulties/set-backs as early as possible
- Respecting the team members' time and values. 
- Split the workload evenly
- Devote four hours weekly to our project
